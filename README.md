# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This project collects, works with and clean a data set related to wearable computing. The data used in this project is linked to from the course website and represents data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  

Run_analysis.R performs the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final output is stored in TidyData.txt

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and all transformations and work that was performed to clean up the data
